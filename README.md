### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andy

I'm an experienced Web Developer working remotely from Indonesia.

For over 10 years, I've developed various websites using JavaScript, PHP, and frameworks like React and Next.js, including unique projects related to Biblical Computing, such as [BaDeNo](https://sabda.id/badeno/) and [SABDA Live](https://live.sabda.org/). I've also led IT projects using Scrum methodology.

mastering Next.js and Python scripting to build more innovative tools and websites.
